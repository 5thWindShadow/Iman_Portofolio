## Risk Assessment Step
1. Define Scope and Objectives
* What assests are you assessing? (Data, Systems, Devices, Network Infra)
* What are your goals? (Identify Vulnerabilities, Comply with regulations, Improve security posture)

2. Identify Assets:
Create a complete inventory of all IT Assets:
* Servers, Desktops, Mobile Devices
* Applications, Databases, Cloud Services
* Network Devices, Routers, Firewalls
* Sensitive Data (financial, personal, intellectual property)

3. Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities:
Use various methods:
* Threat intel reports
* Vuln Scan Tools
* Pentesting
* Expert evaluations
* Industry best practices and compliance frameworks

4. Assess Risk:
* Analyze each identified threat and vulnerability based on:
  * Likelihood : How likely is it to occur? (Rare, Occasional, Frequent)
  * Impact : What are the potential consequences? (Financial loss, Reputational Damage, Data Breaches)
  * Vulnerability Severity : How easy can it be exploited? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  * Existing controls : What security measures are currently in place?
* Use a risk scoring methodology to rank risks based on the combined impact and likelihood (multiplying them)

5. Evaluate and Prioritize Risks:
* Review the risk scores and potential consequences to identify high-priority risks
* Consider factors like ease of mitigation, business impact, and regulatory requirements.

6. Develop control measures:
* For each prioritized risk, define mitigation strategies like:
  * Patching Vulnerability
  * Implementing Stronger Authentication
  * Encrypting sensitive data
  * User Awareness training and security policies
  * Backup and Disaster recovery plans

7. Implement and Monitor:
* Put your control measures into action, testing and verify their effectiveness.
* Continously monitor your systems and network for new threats and vulnerabilities.
* Regularly update your risk assessment as technologies and threats evolve.
